# üèïÔ∏è Outernet

Every summer, Hack Clubbers do something special. In 2023 we ventured out to the [Northeast Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Kingdom) of Vermont for Outernet ‚Äî a four-day experimental coding / camping trip. Together, we turned a semi-abandonded campsite into a bustling hacker oasis.

This is the story of how and why we did it.

<img alt="Everyone in the town square and in front of the Outernet sign." src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/368eac86-3c39-4842-be2c-1436a6db6f07" width="600px" />

Our goal is to open-source everything we have about Outernet from half-baked ideas to our full itemised budget. No two events are the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event. 

## The Concept

Magical moments happen when we take people out of their comfort zone. We've ran countless hackathons in flash indoor spaces, how about doing one outdoors? 

We're surrounded by incredible nature out here in Vermont, it was a great opportunity to do something different. As organisers, we were venturing out of our comfort zones ourselves. That was both exciting and scary for us. We knew that exploring the outdoors would leave attendees with an experience they'd treasure for the rest of their lives; that's what convinced us to go for it.

<img src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/d302f706-202f-4492-93e4-d0db0ecc9b59" width="600px" />

Once we felt confident about running an event outdoors, we started looking for a format. Our initial plan was to focus the event around the concept of building our own hacker village. We were taking inspiration from European hacker camps (eg. [Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org/)), [ToorCamp](https://toorcamp.toorcon.net/), and Burning Man. The idea behind building a hacker village would morph into [guilds](#guilds). Over time, however, our focus became less on the village and more on an individual's experience. We started working with this idea of Outernet being a choose your own adventure event. At previous events of ours, it had always felt like the best moments were the ones attendees created for themselves. We'd find the space, attendees would create their experience. 

Then there was the (slightly contentious) question of "to what extent is Outernet a hackathon?". We wanted everyone to be making and shipping projects just as they would at a hackathon. At the same time, we wanted a hacker's experience to be personalised and flexible. Our approach would be to make Outernet the perfect enviroment for building outdoors and to create an atmosphere in the camp where the cool thing to do at any given time was to be making cool things. Over the weekend, you could ship as many things as you wanted. 

The group's goal was to fill our wall of ships:

<img src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/a61ab4e6-a3d8-4b2f-946a-240c11ca061e" width="600px" />

The weekend would close out with us all coming together to celebrate and demo everything we shipped over the weekend. With a full wall of ships, we'd all have succeeded together.

## Finding The Space

We wanted to do something outdoors, but where? We needed to find a campground for Outernet. Our starting point was a connection to a festival venue in Upstate NY: [Otis Mountain](https://otismountain.com/info).

<img width="600px" alt="Tents set up at Otis Mountain" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/45ec34a4-f361-4cf8-8ee3-c58fb3a4917c">

We ran with that for a long time but, eventually, the complexity of it caught up with us. We wouldn't have running water, septic tanks, a connection to the grid, or a waste disposal service. We were back on the hunt for a venue.

We tried working with a retreat venue. They wanted $50k. 

We almost went with a nudist colony. They refused to give us exclusive access. 

It wasn't looking good, then, an old friend of [Woody](https://woody.vercel.app/) called him back. He was the owner of an old Christian campground, [Covenant Hills Camp](https://covenanthillsvt.org/) in the Northeast Kingdom. They hadn't been fully operational since 2015 but they had large shelters, a connection to the power grid, a large underground water tank, regular waste removal, functional toilets, lukewarm showers, and surprisingly fast DSL internet. Whilst it wouldn't be glamping, Covenant Hills provided us a nice balance between having basic necessities and taking hackers out of their comfort zone.

We went and visited the space, it was exactly what we were looking for.

## The Hackathon

Nature can serve as great inspiration for technical projects; it can also be uncomfortable and distracting. We wanted people to find a balance between exploring the outdoors and coming together to program.

For Outernet to work as a hackathon, we needed to provide: space, inspiration, and an end goal.

### Creating The Space

By default, your classic hackathon chair and table setup doesn't exist at a campground. We set up outdoor seating around the campground as well as three indoor makerspaces: The Barn / The Hardware Shack, The Cafe, and The Cookhouse. Each makerspace had tables and chairs laid out for hackers to work from.

#### The Barn / The Hardware Shack

The Barn was a multipurpose space. During the day, it was "The Hardware Shack", meanwhile, at night it was the home of our performances and our late-night get togethers (more on that later!). The Hardware Shack was the great work of Kevin & Cheru, Hack Clubbers in Boston (MA) & Burlington (VT) respectively. The space was stocked full of old electronic toys from Goodwill, assorted electronics parts, all sorts of hand tools and four 3D printers.

#### The Cafe

The Cafe was a community-ran space; they had barista service 24/7, relaxing music playing on a record player, and art on all of the walls. It became a really nice space for hackers looking for some quite focus time away from the bustle of The Barn and The Cookhouse as they worked on their projects.

#### The Cookhouse

Lastly, we had The Cookhouse. It was also a multipurpose space during the event; alongside being a makerspace, we'd also serve meals (hence the name) and hosted lightning talks in there.

<img width="600px" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-11 at 2 15 49 PM" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/08802388-c2a1-4f25-bee5-28db188422dd">

#### The Internet

The spaces we were using for hacking had internet access, powered by the [OuterLAN](https://github.com/hackclub/outerlan) guild. _[...general description from LAN team]_

#### Workshops & Lightning Talks

We wanted our hacking spaces to also serve as spaces for learning and picking up new skills. Throughout the weekend, we hosted a collection of workshops around the camp and had daily lightning talk sessions. _[...general description from Arav]_  

Every workshop and lightning talk's outline can be found in [`/workshops-and-lightning-talks`](/workshops-and-lightning-talks).

### Providing Inspiration

We created the expectation amongst attendees that Outernet would be a technical event by having every participant set themselves a personal goal and provide a prompt at the Opening Ceremony. 

The prompt we choose was "make people laugh". _[...expand]_

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/8de946c2-3905-4eb9-ace3-f81db75c09d2">

### The End Goal: Shipping & Demos

Demos are the culmination of a hackathon, hackers should leave demos feeling fulfilled and like they've achieved something of the weekend. It gives everyone a special opportunity to see what others made over the weekend and celebrate one another's creations. 

Shipping began during the first hour of Outernet, we set up a big banner in the town square for people to write about the ships. The goal was for the banner to be full by the end of the weekend:

<img width="600px" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-11 at 2 20 35 PM" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/582fc68f-c4c0-428b-9eda-cec3f1c11088">

This encouraged people to build as many projects as they'd like during the event. It also gave the group a collective goal, we'd all win if the board was filled (in contrast to one project being selected as the definite "winner").

At the end of the event, on Sunday, we had demos! We gathered everyone in the town square. To begin, people wrote their final ships on the big piece of cloth. Then, people set up stations to demo their projects from. Everyone had a board like this:

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-11 at 2 25 24 PM" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/48ee9803-256d-441e-8b74-327767845bfb">

On the board, people would be able to paste stickers (like reactions on the Slack) and write congratulatory words (like at the back of a high-school yearbook). Demos brought everyone together and left people with a sense of achievement.

After everyone had shown of their projects to each other, we gathered in the town square again. This time everyone could get up on the rock and give a quick pitch / demo of their project. Everyone hooted and hollered for each other's projects; it was a special moment that provided closure to the weekend and gave everyone the special feeling of being appreciated by a crowd.

## The Camping Experience

Camping is incredible, the shared experience of it is able to bring people together in really special ways. A couple of weeks before Outernet, a bunch of us went camping for a night in Charlotte, VT. We danced around the campfire to music, toasted marshmallows, and chatted for hours around the campfire. We wanted to make sure everyone at Outernet had an equally magical time.

### Sleeping

To start, everyone needed a place to sleep and that meant acquiring tents and camping supplies for over 150 people. We worked with a local company called [KitLender](https://www.kitlender.com/) and hired a tent crew to help us with setup. KitLender provided us a collection of six to twelve person tents (we had them at approx. 75% capacity). They also provided each a hacker with a sleeping bag, a sleeping mat, a camping pillow and a headlight.

At check-in, to help hackers with settling in and getting setup, we sorted everyone into groups of approximately 20 people (sleeping pods). They had a leader who would help them find a tent and get all their gear. It was certainly a change up from previous hackathons; in some ways, sleeping with comfortable gear is an improvement but sleeping in a small shared space was certainly a new experience for some hackers.

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/0319430a-d1e7-4cfc-98da-dfe1f332e2f7">

### Guilds

Earlier on we mentioned the idea of building our own hacker village, guilds were our final implementation of that idea. Guilds gave hackers a framework to run their own things during Outernet. If there's something a hacker would like to have at Outernet, they started a guild focused on it. We gave each guild $250 in funding through [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank) and helped them secure tents for their guild. On the day, guilds brought the campground alive. Each of them brought their own unique thing to the event ranging from crochet materials to boat building tools. The full list of guilds is at [`guilds.md`](guilds.md).

### Food

By virtue of being in the middle of nowhere, we had to make food for everyone on site ourselves. Fortunately, we had an industrial kitchen on site that we could use to prepare food in. We hired a friend of Hack Club's, Lonny, to lead the kitchen crew. Every night his crew would cook up a homemade meal (baked ziti, hamburgers, hot dogs, and pasta)and serve it at The Cookhouse. Meanwhile, for lunches, we did build-your-own sandwiches / salads. For most days, breakfast was a relatively simple continental buffet (yogurt, cereal, breads etc.). On Sunday morning, we made a special pancake breakfast using maple syrup for the farm next door to us.

Lonny did an incredible job; every meal was a joy to consume and it was nice to have so many locally-source ingredients.

### Tomfoolery

We've mentioned him before but now feels like a good time to introduce Woody, an incredible actor / performer, and professional clown. We've known him since HQ moved to Vermont and regularly head up to concerts on Mt. Foolery which Woody runs. Woody was Outernet's Coordinator of Fools.

One of our nightly rituals was to gather everyone for show at the end of each day. On the first evening, after dinner, we kicked things off with an outdoor show a marching band leading us through the camp, fire dances, and a man on silts getting up to all sorts of shenanigans. 

<img height="200" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/eb2883a9-a646-4552-bdf2-85a547e51576">
<img height="200" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/ad54c475-15af-4ce9-86a2-36892f54f34d">

We then transitioned into the opening ceremony and made the the first ship on the ship board. The shows on the second and third night were both in The Barn. As the rain bucketed down on the second night, we were all enjoying a collection of acts including a local circus troop (Circus Smirkus), musical performances from our band, and physical comedy. 

<img height="300" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/73dcd426-aacc-454d-bd18-38d1647e19bb">

Finally, on the third night, we had a (late night) Early Evening Show with a character named Mike Miclon. It was just like your classic American evening show with featured interviews, bizarre performances and a charismatic host... plus a "qualified" doctor.

<img height="300" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/295ac850-3611-4951-9e5d-1fbd26b115cc"> <img height="300" src="https://github.com/hackclub/outernet/assets/39828164/df0bd5c0-1d29-4270-ab56-19957a113f83">

Fires 

Throughout the weekend, all sorts of shenanigans were going on. Some of it was organised by us, other events... just sprang out of nowhere. That was the magic of it all. 

On the first night, after dinner, we had a massive bonfire (s/o to our tent crew: Nick, Asa, and Colin) which involved fire dancing, a man on silts, and a marching band leading us through the camp. 

After dinner and a conveniently timed rainbow, the sun set and we gathered back around the fire for the shrine of the ship! It was madness. We had bongos going, cult-like chanting about shipping projects (the goal was to rally up excitement about demos), campfire songs (Wonderwall!) and smores (in return for a ship on the banner).

And as we got deeper into the night, people started slowly heading off to sleep but then we had a DISCO. It was ran by Sarthak & the rave guild. We mixed it up with cake and celsius! It was wild, Zach even danced to bollywood.

Everyone woke up very late that morning. It was a slow start and the day was focused on heads-down hacking. (That was until the afternoon... where we had a break to have a water ballon fight and a boat building competition). 

We also wanted to have a special moment that night, after dinner, we hosted a series of small campfires and light up the lake with floating lanterns. The moon was very large that night and it was a lovely closing to the day.
