# üèïÔ∏è Outernet

Every summer, Hack Clubbers do something special. In 2023 we ventured out to the [Northeast Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Kingdom) of Vermont for Outernet ‚Äî a four-day experimental coding / camping trip. Together, we turned a semi-abandonded campsite into a bustling hacker oasis.

This is the story of how and why we did it.

Our goal is to open-source everything we have about Outernet from half-baked ideas to our full itemised budget. No two events are the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event. 

## The Concept

Magical moments happen when we take people out of their comfort zone. We've ran countless hackathons indoors, how about doing one outdoors? The idea was floated early on in planning discussion and it kind of just stuck around. As we got more confident in the idea of doing it outdoors, we started to plan around this idea of building our own hacker village. We took inspiration from European hacker camps (eg. [Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org/)), [ToorCamp](https://toorcamp.toorcon.net/), and Burning Man. And with that, Outernet was born*.

At this point the concept was still a bit unclear (and, to be honest it kind of was all the way up until the week of the event). The idea behind building a hacker village would morph into guilds (see below). Over time, however, our focus became less on the village and more on an individual's experience. We started working with this idea of Outernet being a choose your own adventure event. The thinking behind that was that at previous events, it had always felt like the best moments were the once attendees created for themselves. 

Lastly, there was the question of "to what extent is Outernet a hackathon?". Here's where there was a lot of back and forth on the team. We wanted everyone to be making and shipping projects like at a hackathon but we didn't want to have the compeditive aspect of it. We also had to deal with the fact that the internet would (by design) be imperfect and that that would make collaboration hard. We landed with running Outernet as a hackathon where you could ship as many things as you wanted (encouraging simpler projects) and, in the end, we'd all win together.

## Finding The Space

At this point, we'd normally start reaching out to companies to ask to use their office. Not this time... we needed to find a campground. That brings in all sorts of considerations, septic tanks for example! Serious. Our starting point was a connection to a festival venue in Upstate NY: [Otis Mountain](https://otismountain.com/info). We ran with that for a long time but, eventually, the complexity of it caught up with us. We wouldn't have running water, septic tanks, a connection to the grid, or a waste disposal service. So, we were back on the hunt for a venue. 

And that was tough. We searched far and wide. We tried working with a retreat venue. They wanted $50k. We almost used a nudist colony. They refused to give us exclusive access. Then, an old friend of Woody's called him back. He was the owner of an old Christian campground named Covenant Hills. They hadn't been fully operational since 2015 but they had large shelters, a connection to the power grid, a large underground water tank, regualar waste removal, functional toilets, lukewarm showers, and suprisingly fast DSL internet. It wouldn't be glamping but it was a nice balance between comfort and discomfort. 

We were all on a Zoom call when they called back... when we heard from Woody, a big wave of relief swept the room. Hooray!

We went and visited the space. It was perfect. (And now we were able to launch).
