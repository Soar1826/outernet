# üèïÔ∏è Outernet

Every summer, Hack Clubbers do something special. In 2023 we ventured out to the [Northeast Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Kingdom) of Vermont for Outernet ‚Äî a four-day experimental coding / camping trip. Together, we turned a semi-abandonded campsite into a bustling hacker oasis.

This is the story of how and why we did it.

Our goal is to open-source everything we have about Outernet from half-baked ideas to our full itemised budget. No two events are the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event.
