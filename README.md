# üèïÔ∏è Outernet

Every summer, Hack Clubbers do something special. In 2023 we ventured out to the [Northeast Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Kingdom) of Vermont for Outernet ‚Äî a four-day experimental coding / camping trip. Together, we turned a semi-abandonded campsite into a bustling hacker oasis.

This is the story of how and why we did it.

Our goal is to open-source everything we have about Outernet from half-baked ideas to our full itemised budget. No two events are the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event. 

## The Concept

Magical moments happen when we take people out of their comfort zone. We've ran countless hackathons indoors, how about doing one outdoors? The idea was floated early on in planning discussion and it kind of just stuck around. As we got more confident in the idea of doing it outdoors, we started to plan around this idea of building our own hacker village. We took inspiration from European hacker camps (eg. [Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org/)), [ToorCamp](https://toorcamp.toorcon.net/), and Burning Man. And with that, Outernet was born*.

At this point the concept was still a bit unclear (and, to be honest it kind of was all the way up until the week of the event). The idea behind building a hacker village would morph into guilds (see below). Over time, however, our focus became less on the village and more on an individual's experience. We started working with this idea of Outernet being a choose your own adventure event. The thinking behind that was that at previous events, it had always felt like the best moments were the once attendees created for themselves. 

Lastly, there was the question of "to what extent is Outernet a hackathon?". Here's where there was a lot of back and forth on the team. We wanted everyone to be making and shipping projects like at a hackathon but we didn't want to have the compeditive aspect of it. We also had to deal with the fact that the internet would (by design) be imperfect and that that would make collaboration hard. We landed with running Outernet as a hackathon where you could ship as many things as you wanted (encouraging simpler projects) and, in the end, we'd all win together.

## Finding The Space

At this point, we'd normally start reaching out to companies to ask to use their office. Not this time... we needed to find a campground. That brings in all sorts of considerations, septic tanks for example! Serious. Our starting point was a connection to a festival venue in Upstate NY: [Otis Mountain](https://otismountain.com/info). We ran with that for a long time but, eventually, the complexity of it caught up with us. We wouldn't have running water, septic tanks, a connection to the grid, or a waste disposal service. So, we were back on the hunt for a venue. 

And that was tough. We searched far and wide. We tried working with a retreat venue. They wanted $50k. We almost used a nudist colony. They refused to give us exclusive access. Then, an old friend of Woody's called him back. He was the owner of an old Christian campground named Covenant Hills. They hadn't been fully operational since 2015 but they had large shelters, a connection to the power grid, a large underground water tank, regualar waste removal, functional toilets, lukewarm showers, and suprisingly fast DSL internet. It wouldn't be glamping but it was a nice balance between comfort and discomfort. 

We were all on a Zoom call when they called back... when we heard from Woody, a big wave of relief swept the room. Hooray!

We went and visited the space. It was perfect. (And now we were able to launch).

## The Hackathon

This is Hack Club. We wanted it to be a technical event. The great outdoors can be a really productive place and nature can serve as great inspiration for technical projects; it can also be very distracting. We wanted people to enjoy the uniqueness of the outdoors and build cool shit at the same time. It was all about finding a balance.

### Spaces for Hacking

First of all, people need space to build their projects! In an office, this is easy, everyone sits at desks and shared tables. That sort of space doesn't exist by default at a campground. We'd need to create it. We boiled it down to people needing comfortable seating with tables on which they could collaborate. 

We ended up setting up outdoor seating as well as three indoor makerspaces: The Barn / The Hardware Shack, The Cafe, and The Cookhouse. All the indoor spaces had tables set up with four to eight chairs.

#### The Barn / The Hardware Shack

The Barn was a multipurpose space for us during the event. During the day, it was "The Hardware Shack", meanwhile, at night it was the home of our performances and late-night get togethers (more on that later!). The Hardware Shack was the great work of Kevin & Cheru, Hack Clubbers in Boston (MA) & Burlington (VT) respectivly. The space was stocked full of old electronic toys (from Goodwill), assorted electronics parts, all sorts of hand tools and four 3D printers. The space was incredible and all the tools inspired some super cool projects (check them out!).

#### The Cafe

The Cafe was a community-ran space; they had barista service 24/7, relaxing music playing on a record player, and art on all of the walls. It became a really nice space for hackers looking for some quite focus time away from the bustle of The Barn and The Cookhouse as they worked on their projects. We also hosted workshops in The Cafe.

#### The Cookhouse

Lastly, we had The Cookhouse. It was also a multipurpose space during the event; alongside being a makerspace, we'd also serve meals (hence the name) and hosted lightning talks in there. It was the most flexible of spaces we had. 

### Guilds

Guilds were a framework for hackers to do things during Outernet. If there's something a hacker would like to have at Outernet, they started a guild focused on it. There was once a time when everything had an associated guild - an engineers' guild, a musicians' guild, a farmers' guild etc. Each guild contributed something specific back to society. At Outernet, guilds were much the same; each guild has a specific theme / purpose and all of them will contribute to the overall atmosphere of our camp.

Guilds brought the campground alive. Each of them brought their own unique thing to the event ranging from crochet materials to boat building tools. The full list of guilds is at `guilds.md`.
