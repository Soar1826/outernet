# üèïÔ∏è Outernet

Every summer, Hack Clubbers do something special. In 2023 we ventured out to the [Northeast Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Kingdom) of Vermont for Outernet ‚Äî a four-day experimental coding / camping trip. Together, we turned a semi-abandonded campsite into a bustling hacker oasis.

This is the story of how and why we did it.

Our goal is to open-source everything we have about Outernet from half-baked ideas to our full itemised budget. No two events are the same but we hope that within this repository you can find inspiration for you own special event. 

## The Concept

Magical moments happen when we take people out of their comfort zone. We've ran countless hackathons indoors, how about doing one outdoors? The idea was floated early on in planning discussion and it kind of just stuck around. As we got more confident in the idea of doing it outdoors, we started to plan around this idea of building our own hacker village. We took inspiration from European hacker camps (eg. [Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org/)), [ToorCamp](https://toorcamp.toorcon.net/), and Burning Man. And with that, Outernet was born*.

At this point the concept was still a bit unclear (and, to be honest it kind of was all the way up until the week of the event). The idea behind building a hacker village would morph into guilds (see below). Over time, however, our focus became less on the village and more on an individual's experience. We started working with this idea of Outernet being a choose your own adventure event. The thinking behind that was that at previous events, it had always felt like the best moments were the once attendees created for themselves. 

Lastly, there was the question of "to what extent is Outernet a hackathon?". Here's where there was a lot of back and forth on the team. We wanted everyone to be making and shipping projects like at a hackathon but we didn't want to have the compeditive aspect of it. We also had to deal with the fact that the internet would (by design) be imperfect and that that would make collaboration hard. We landed with running Outernet as a hackathon where you could ship as many things as you wanted (encouraging simpler projects) and, in the end, we'd all win together.

## Finding The Space

At this point, we'd normally start reaching out to companies to ask to use their office. Not this time... we needed to find a campground. That brings in all sorts of considerations, septic tanks for example! Serious. Our starting point was a connection to a festival venue in Upstate NY: [Otis Mountain](https://otismountain.com/info). We ran with that for a long time but, eventually, the complexity of it caught up with us. We wouldn't have running water, septic tanks, a connection to the grid, or a waste disposal service. So, we were back on the hunt for a venue. 

And that was tough. We searched far and wide. We tried working with a retreat venue. They wanted $50k. We almost used a nudist colony. They refused to give us exclusive access. Then, an old friend of Woody's called him back. He was the owner of an old Christian campground named Covenant Hills. They hadn't been fully operational since 2015 but they had large shelters, a connection to the power grid, a large underground water tank, regualar waste removal, functional toilets, lukewarm showers, and suprisingly fast DSL internet. It wouldn't be glamping but it was a nice balance between comfort and discomfort. 

We were all on a Zoom call when they called back... when we heard from Woody, a big wave of relief swept the room. Hooray!

We went and visited the space. It was perfect. (And now we were able to launch).

## The Hackathon

This is Hack Club. We wanted it to be a technical event. The great outdoors can be a really productive place and nature can serve as great inspiration for technical projects; it can also be very distracting. We wanted people to enjoy the uniqueness of the outdoors and build cool shit at the same time. It was all about finding a balance.

### Spaces for Hacking

First of all, people need space to build their projects! In an office, this is easy, everyone sits at desks and shared tables. That sort of space doesn't exist by default at a campground. We'd need to create it. We boiled it down to people needing comfortable seating with tables on which they could collaborate. 

We ended up setting up outdoor seating as well as three indoor makerspaces: The Barn / The Hardware Shack, The Cafe, and The Cookhouse. All the indoor spaces had tables set up with four to eight chairs.

#### The Barn / The Hardware Shack

The Barn was a multipurpose space for us during the event. During the day, it was "The Hardware Shack", meanwhile, at night it was the home of our performances and late-night get togethers (more on that later!). The Hardware Shack was the great work of Kevin & Cheru, Hack Clubbers in Boston (MA) & Burlington (VT) respectivly. The space was stocked full of old electronic toys (from Goodwill), assorted electronics parts, all sorts of hand tools and four 3D printers. The space was incredible and all the tools inspired some super cool projects (check them out!).

#### The Cafe

The Cafe was a community-ran space; they had barista service 24/7, relaxing music playing on a record player, and art on all of the walls. It became a really nice space for hackers looking for some quite focus time away from the bustle of The Barn and The Cookhouse as they worked on their projects. We also hosted workshops in The Cafe.

#### The Cookhouse

Lastly, we had The Cookhouse. It was also a multipurpose space during the event; alongside being a makerspace, we'd also serve meals (hence the name) and hosted lightning talks in there. It was the most flexible of spaces we had. 

### Guilds

Guilds were a framework for hackers to do things during Outernet. If there's something a hacker would like to have at Outernet, they started a guild focused on it. There was once a time when everything had an associated guild - an engineers' guild, a musicians' guild, a farmers' guild etc. Each guild contributed something specific back to society. At Outernet, guilds were much the same; each guild has a specific theme / purpose and all of them will contribute to the overall atmosphere of our camp.

Guilds brought the campground alive. Each of them brought their own unique thing to the event ranging from crochet materials to boat building tools. The full list of guilds is at `guilds.md`.

### Goal-setting

We needed create the expectation amongst attendees that Outernet would be a technical event.

### Shipping & Demos

Demos are the culmination of a hackathon, it's important for hackers to leave feeling fulfilled and like they've acheived something of the weekend. It also gives everyone a special oppourtinity to see what others made over the weekend and celebrate one another's work. 

Shipping start from the first hour of Outernet, we set up a big banner in the town square for people to write about the ships. The goal was for the banner to be full by the end of the weekend.

The thinking here was that we would be able to encourage people to build as many projects as they'd like during the event. It also gave the group a collective goal, we'd all win if the board was filled (in contrast to one project being selected as the definite "winner").

At the end of the event, on Sunday, we had demos! We gathered everyone in the town square. To begin, people wrote their final ships on the big piece of cloth. Then, people set up stations to demo their projects from. Everyone had a board like this:

On the board, people would be able to paste stickers (like reactions on the Slack) and write congratulatory words (like at the back of a high-school yearbook). This left people feeling fulfilled and brought everyone together. The focus was on celebrating everyone. 

And then after everyone had shown of their projects to each other, we gathered in the town square again. This time everyone could get up on the rock and give a quick pitch / demo of their project. This was special because everyone got to hoot and hooler for everyone's projects, providing closure to the weekend and the special feeling of being appreciated by a crowd.

## The Camping Experience

That's the technical side! But we also wanted to have fun! And that's where camping came in. Camping is incredible, the shared hardship of it is able to bring people together. We had to make sure that everyone was set up to camping and that there were great things to do all weekend so that people could make friends and have fun. 

### Sleeping

Everyone needs a place to sleep - we needed to acquire tents and camping supplies for over 150 people. We worked with a local company called KitLender and hired in additional staff (our tent crew). They provided us a collection of 6 to 12 person tents (we didn't have them at full capacity). They also provided each a hacker with a sleeping bag, a sleeping mat, a camping pillow and a headlight.

We also had to make sure that everyone found a place to sleep! That's where the sleeping pods came in. At check-in, we sorted folks into groups of approximately 20 people. They had a leader who would help them get settled in and then they'd all sleep in a similar area. 

It was certainly a change up from previous hackathons! In some ways, sleeping with comfortable gear is an improvement but sleeping in a shared space was certainly a new experience for some.

### Shenangians & Entertainment 

Throughout the weekend, all sorts of shenanigans were going on. Some of it was organised by us, other events... just sprang out of nowhere. That was the magic of it all. 

All of our entertainment was coordinated by Woody - an incredible actor and performer, and professional clown. We've known him for a couple of years now since he was Zach's landlord. 

On the first night, after dinner, we had a massive bonfire (s/o to our tent crew: Nick, Asa, and Colin) which involved fire dancing, a man on silts, and a marching band leading us through the camp. That was followed by an opening ceremony and the first ship on the ship board!

It was late so people then headed off to do starting hacking, grab some Ben & Jerry's, do their own thing with new friends, or sleep.

We were up early the next morning and after a hearty breakfast, we broke the ice with a game ran by Sunny Day (a parody camp counselor who hung around for the weekend) and Woody.

Then it was off to hacking!

That night we had a show. We had Circus, we had a band and we had physical comedy. Gave everyone a laugh even though it rained.

After dinner and a convienntly timed rainbow, the sun set and we gathered back around the fire for the shrine of the ship! It was madness. We had bongos going, cult-like chanting about shipping projects (the goal was to rally up excitement about demos), campfire songs (Wonderwall!) and smores (in return for a ship on the banner).

And as we got deeper into the night, people started slowly heading off to sleep but then we had a DISCO. It was ran by Sarthak & the rave guild. We mixed it up with cake and celsius! It was wild, Zach even danced to bollywood.

Everyone woke up very late that morning. It was a slow start and the day was focused on heads-down hacking. (That was until the afternoon... where we had a break to have a water ballon fight and a boat building competition). 

After demos though it was time to celebrate! We had a (late night) Early Evening Show with a character named Mike Miclon. It featured interviews, bizarre performances and a charismatic host... plus a qualified doctor.

We also wanted to have a special moment that night, after dinner, we hosted a series of small campfires and light up the lake with floating lanterns. The moon was very large that night and it was a lovely closing to the day.

### Food

We were in the middle of nowhere, we needed to make our own food! We had a full industrial kitchen. We hired Lonny and his crew to make a homemade meal every night. For our dinners, we had baked ziti, hamburgers, hot dogs, and pasta. For lunch we did build-your-own sandwiches. For most days, breakfast was fairly simple (yogurt, cereal, breads etc. but on Sunday morning, we made it special by having our own pancakes. It was all super tasty and it was nice that a lot of ingredients were local (eg. the maple syrup for the pancakes was made literally next door).
