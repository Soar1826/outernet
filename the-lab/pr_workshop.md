## Margin vs Padding ğŸ¤”

### Plan

> The workshop is meant to help participants distinguish the difference between Margin and Padding, which are attributes of HTML elements that control how big an element is and how spaced out elements get.
> The workshop would talk about each attribute using modern-day references and then participants will get to do hands-on exercises on an IDE to help understand the difference more.

#### Outline

1. I go through a powerpoint/slideshow explaining the differences between margin and padding (should take approximately 5 minutes)
2. After the powerpoint is done, participants will go on repl.it and create a new HTML repl
3. In the repl, the participants will explore different margin and padding settings (I will walk them through the different settings)
4. At the end, participants will compete in creating their own art piece by the use of many different DIVs, color settings and padding/margin settings with HTML/CSS
